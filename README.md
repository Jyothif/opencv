# Thresholding:
`Thresholding is used to simplify visual data for further analysis. In image processing, we need to pre-process the image data and get the important details. This technique is important to separate background image and foreground image. Image is colorful and it will contain 3 values ranging from 0-255 for every pixel. In thresholding, first,I have convert the image in gray-scale. So for a gray-scale image,only need 1 value for every pixel ranging from 0-255. By converting the image, I have reduced the data.`

# Edge Detection:
`This is technique used in edge detection for calculate the edges of the images`
- Thus edges sudden changes into sharpen or shiny edges which the makes image more clear
- Edge detection improves the images and improves the image quality to recognize
- `cv2.Canny()` is used to detect the edges of the images, most popular function to detect the edges.
