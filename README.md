# Thresholding:
`Thresholding is used to simplify visual data for further analysis. In image processing, we need to pre-process the image data and get the important details. This technique is important to separate background image and foreground image. Image is colorful and it will contain 3 values ranging from 0-255 for every pixel. In thresholding, first,I have convert the image in gray-scale. So for a gray-scale image,only need 1 value for every pixel ranging from 0-255. By converting the image, I have reduced the data.`
